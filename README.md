**4-Channel WiFi Power Meter Using Wemos D1 and INA226 (or Compatible INAxxx Sensors)**

This project utilizes the Wemos D1 (ESP8266) microcontroller paired with INA226 current/voltage sensors (or any compatible INAxxx series) to provide precise, real-time measurements of electrical parameters across four independent channels.

Technical Specifications:

    Voltage Measurement Range: up to 36 V DC per channel

    Current Measurement Range: up to 20 A per channel

    Sensor: INA226 (bidirectional current and voltage sensor with high accuracy)

    Microcontroller: Wemos D1 (ESP8266) for WiFi connectivity and data transmission

    Communication: Wireless data streaming via WiFi for remote monitoring

    Applications: Multi-channel power consumption monitoring, load analysis, and energy management
